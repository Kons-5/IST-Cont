# Cont - Automatic Control

This repository contains `Cont.pdf`, the PDF summarizing the entire content covered in a Automatic Control class.

## Key contents
 
- Modeling of physical systems: representative examples; dynamical systems linearization. 
- Control objectives: stability and performance; robust stability and performance in the presence of modelling uncertainty 
- Block diagrams: rules for block transformation and reduction. 
- Stability of linear time invariant systems; natural response. 
- Impact of feedback: reference tracking, disturbance and noise attenuation, steady state errors. 
- Control systems analysis and design using “root-locus”-based techniques; PID controllers. 
- Control systems analysis and design in the frequency domain using Nyquist/Bode techniques; gain and phase margins, stability in the presence of delays. 
- Lead and lag compensation techniques. 
- Introduction to control system's design using “loop-shaping” techniques.
